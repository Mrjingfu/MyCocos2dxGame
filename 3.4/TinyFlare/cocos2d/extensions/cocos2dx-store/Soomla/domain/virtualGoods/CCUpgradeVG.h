     @class CCUpgradeVG
     @brief An upgrade virtual good is one virtual good in a series of virtual 
     goods that define an upgrade scale of an associated `CCVirtualGood`.
     
     This type of virtual good is best explained with an example:
     Let's say there's a "strength" attribute to one of the characters in your 
     game and that strength is on a scale of 1-5. You want to provide your users
     with the ability to upgrade that strength.
     This is what you'll need to create:
     1. `CCSingleUseVG` for "strength"
     2. `CCUpgradeVG` for strength 'level 1'
     3. `CCUpgradeVG` for strength 'level 2'
     4. `CCUpgradeVG` for strength 'level 3'
     5. `CCUpgradeVG` for strength 'level 4'
     6. `CCUpgradeVG` for strength 'level 5'
     When the user buys this `UpgradeVG`, we check and make sure the appropriate
     conditions are met and buy it for you (which actually means we upgrade the
     associated `CCVirtualGood`).
     
     NOTE: In case you want this item to be available for purchase with real $$
     you'll need to define it in the Market (Google Play, App Store, etc...).
