/**
 This exception is thrown when a user tries to equip a virtual good which he/she does not own.
 
 Real Game Example:
  Example Inventory: { currency_coin: 100, robot_character: 3 }
  Suppose that your user would like to equip (LOCAL) a robot_character.
  You'll probably call `equipVirtualGood("robot_character")`.
  NotEnoughGoodException will be thrown with "robot_character" as the `itemId`.
  You can catch this exception in order to notify the user that he/she doesn't
  own a robot_character (so he/she cannot equip it!).
